## Development

- `git clone`, `npm i`
- Setup your [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/) account, then put the public key in the `ContactForm/index.ts` component;
- Use your fonts of preference (local imports are in the `./src/index.scss` file) - i used [Neue Montreal](https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-montreal) mostly.
- `npm start`
- Start coding and enjoy ðŸ¤

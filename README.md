This repo contains the source code of my portfolio website.

## Made with:

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-4B4B4B?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white) ![Three.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/three.js-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=three.js&logoColor=white) ![Sass](https://img.shields.io/badge/Sass-CC6699?style=for-the-badge&logo=sass&logoColor=white)

## Potential optimizations

- More sections, perhaps a detailed tech stack one but I've got one on my github profile already
- More info about a project on click, maybe some :onhover modal effect
- More flashy **three.js** sort of stuff
- Fireworks, idk

## Development

- `git clone`, `npm i`
- Setup your [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/) account, then put the public key in the `ContactForm/index.ts` component;
- Use your fonts of preference (local imports are in the `./src/index.scss` file) - i used [Neue Montreal](https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-montreal) mostly.
- `npm start`
- Start coding and enjoy ðŸ¤

## Development

- `git clone`
- `npm i`
- Setup your [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/) account
- Use your fonts of preference (local imports are in the `./src/index.scss` file)

I had to exclude `./src/fonts` folder from the repo since there were copyrighted ones - [Neue Montreal](https://pangrampangram.com/products/neue-montreal), to be specific. You can download it from the owner's website, it's free for personal use.

        I&apos;m a seasoned <span>QA Engineer</span> with some knowledge in many
        fascinating programming concepts - from reverse engineering, to
        knowledge of 3d libraries, like <span>three.js</span>.

        I got into coding thanks to games - as a person who&apos;s never had a
        console I found myself often troubleshooting weird PC issues, setting up
        servers, old games, modding games, reading about stuff I didn&apos;t
        have a single idea about, just to get one thing done. As an adult, I
        find myself fitting in this craftsmanship. Right now I&apos;m into{' '}
        <i>
          web dev, scripting, any type of game modding, testing, 3d modeling.

        I&apos;m constantly looking for some fine fellers to build projects
        with. Hit me up if you would be interested in colaboration. I&apos;m
        planning on:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Exploring Three.js to infinity and beyond - I fell in love with what
          this library offers
        </li>
        <li>
          Making games, multiple genres - I&apos;m lazily learning game engines
        </li>
        <li>Building the best possible fullstack applications</li>
        <li>Extending my automation testing skills</li>
      </ul>
